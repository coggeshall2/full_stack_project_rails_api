# WDI-03 Providence Project \#2 - Serenity Trails Logger

## Overview

For my second project at General Assembly I was tasked with creating a full stack Single
Page Application for the web that would allow a user to login with authentication
credentials and handle all CRUD actions on a Rails API that I created with generated scaffold
commands.  My user stories for this project were:

- A user needs to create a new account
- A user needs to login
- A user needs view all their trails
- A user needs to search for a trail
- A user needs to update a trail
- A user needs to create a new trail
- A user needs to delete a trail
- A user needs to change their password
- A user needs to logout


In addition to these user stories, some of the project requirements were:

- The app must be deployed on Github pages.
- Must make frequent, cohesive commits dating back to the first day of building the app.
- Must create this README and document the process and technologies used
- Must use jQuery for DOM manipulation and AJAX for interacting with the provided API

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Google Fonts
- Ruby on rails
-
HTML5 is used to build the basic structure of the app and CSS3 to style.

Javascript is used to build the form fields, send AJAX calls and jQuery is used to interact with the DOM and update the view.

Ruby on rails is used for the backend API operations.

## Updates
I am working on creating a better UI that is styled with imagery and eventually connecting to a 3rd party API allowing for a search of all trails within their database.
